## Introduction to 7 Seconds or Less

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

+ Pioneered by Mike D'Antoni while at the Phoenix Suns (now with Houston Rockets) in 2004

+ The Suns went from a 28-54 record in 2003, to 62-20 the next season
  
+ The strategy:

  - More field goals attempted leads to more field goals made

  - The goal was to get a shot up in less than 7 seconds for every offensive possession
  
  - Often criticized because of the lack of concentration on the defensive end
  
+ In short, the offense is focused on three areas:

  - High volume three point shooting
  
  - High percentage two point shots from within the painted area
  
  - Minimize opportunities for turnovers

## Regarding 3-Point Efficiency

<div style="float: left; width: 48%;">

+ Initial theory was that a high volume of 3P attempts (alone) would increase win percentage.

  - It turns out, there needs to be a level of efficiency to go along with the high attempt rate.
  
+ 38% appears to be the magical efficiency rating

  - Remember, 3PA is important too!

  - There's a big difference between shooting 4/10 (12 points) from three, versus shooting 12/30 (36 points)
  
+ Incidentally, it turns out that because of the increased win percentage, chances of making the playoffs also improve

  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.36, y = 0.905, label = "Blue denotes playoff teams")

## Data Suggests Limiting Two-Point Attempts

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

+ Teams should only be attempting a maximum of 61 2P shots per game over the course of a season
  
+ Take less, make more

  - A team's goal should be to take less 2P, but make them with high efficiency
  
  - This is what the Suns and Rockets have done with D'Antoni as their coach
  
  - Take less 2P, but when one is taken, make sure it's a high percentage shot
  
+ Take the previous example:
  
  - To score 36 points on 40% shooting from three takes 30 possessions
  
  - To score 36 points on 40% shooting from two takes 45 possessions (+15)!

## Wrap-Up

+ The 7 Seconds or Less philosophy has been incredibly effective in the past two decades

+ Much of the strategy correlates to a higher win percentage

+ Suggestions to NBA front offices, coaches, and players:

  - Take more threes, while maintaining a 38% success rate
  
  - Take less twos, but make them at a more frequent rate
